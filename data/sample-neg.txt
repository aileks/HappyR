The customer service experience was terrible. I waited on hold for 45 minutes only to be disconnected. When I finally reached someone, they were rude and unhelpful.

The product quality was extremely poor. It broke within three days of purchase despite minimal use. The materials felt cheap and flimsy compared to what was advertised.

I am deeply disappointed and frustrated with this entire experience. I regret my purchase and would strongly advise others against buying from this company. This has been a complete waste of my time and money.
